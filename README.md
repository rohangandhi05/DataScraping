# DataScraping learning module

Wanted to learn how to scrape Premier Stats in the hopes of applying such skills in a ML regression model. 

**Steps I used:**

1) Utilized Annaconda Api


2) Entered Jupyter Notebook


3) Scraped data for all game dates per season instead of games played in a year that way I am not wasting resources and computing power 


4) Using this data, scraped all according game data based off each game date


5) Formatted all this data to be easy accessible via a csv file
